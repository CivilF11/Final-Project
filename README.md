In addition to the options, a high score database will be kept. With the several levels and difficulties, many leader boards will be implemented to keep track of each situation. The database will be created using phpMyAdmin and implemented with MySQL. Everytime the player dies, they will be asked to add their score to the leaderboard under a given name.
